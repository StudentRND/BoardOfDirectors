- CodeDay Fall 2015 statistics looked promising:
  - Girls - 42% (up 4 points)
  - Minorities - 22% (up 6 points)
  - Low-income: 34% (up 4 points)
  - NPS: 74 (up 6 points)
  - Profit this season: ~$5,500, still waiting on some final things to close
  - Partnerships with school districts: Phoenix Central, Monteray County Schools Migrant Education + general, Richland (SC)
- CodeDay Winter 2016 prep has started:
  - Same cities, might not have NYC again as we have no organizer still
  - Switching to new contract model
  - Many cities already have venues confirmed, e.g. SV -- working with them on sponsorships
- Sponsorships are going okay:
  - Local sponsorships -- goal of $600 per city at 20 cities ($12,000)
  - Submitted two grants with feedback from some of the people who recommended us; will hear back Q1 2016. Looking into more. Working with some RMs on local ones (e.g. Phoenix, Boulder)
  - Splunk soft yes on 2016, Corey thinks they might be interested in doing more this year because of new CEO who's interested in giving.
  - LexisNexis yes on $25,000 (wasn't able to upsell).

Edward brought up the subject of increasing the salary of the Executive Director, but Tyler mentioned that he would be more comfortable waiting to make any salary decisions until another
global sponsor closed. Edward agreed to table the discussion until then.

Edward discussed his findings regarding finding a new chairman. According to Edward, all board members agreed Zaq would be the best choice to take over the role of chairman after Edward
leaves the board. Zaq agreed that he would take on the role, but asked for additional guidance as to what would be expected of him for the role. Tyler agreed to create a "job description"
for the role of Chairman of the Board as a template, and present it to the board for consideration and further discussion, in order to provide some guidance to Zaq.

Edward then discussed the transition plan. It was agreed that, while Edward would officially remain the chair until the next board meeting, Tyler would take over several of the
responsibilities in the meantime, specifically: scheduling board meetings, sending agendas, and board member recruitment.

Tyler discussed recruitment of new members for the board, and it was decided that recruiting new members should be a priority. Edward brought up the idea of adding Bob Crimmins to the
board, and reception to that idea was positive. Tyler said he would meet with Bob to find out more about potential contributions he could make, as well as his interest in the role,
and make a recommendation back to the board at the next meeting. 

The board agreed it would be best to meet before the holidays, and asked Tyler to handle the task of coordinating that meeting.

## Adjournment of Meeting

The meeting was adjourned at 8:00pm by Edward Jiang.
