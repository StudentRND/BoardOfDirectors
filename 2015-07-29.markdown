Tyler Presented the Executive Director Report

- There were several action items decided on at the strategic offsite, which were turned into a specific plan:
	- Brett's involvement was ramped-down to 7/21, and completely terminated as of 7/21.
		- Bryan Rivera was brought on to help out with interm partnerships as a volunteer until Aug 1.
		- Tyler started working with Zaq to set up a fundraising event at TUNE.
		- Tyler talked with Ed and Christy about parent donation plan. Edward was against
		- Brett delivered current information on sponsors.
		- Bryan began helping RMs with partnerships.
		- Reached out to several existing partners in many cities. Took longer than expected to get meetings with some of them, and have largely not been going too well -- local sponsors are largely hesitant to up their commitment. Will continue to work on this in the future.

Edward asked to discuss the fundraising event in more detail, because he did not think it was a good use of time. Tyler brought up that it was the most effective way he could think of to make immediate progress with engagement in Seattle, which was a key region. Charlie brought up that in the long run, StudentRND should be looking to have as many touchpoints with parents as possible to increase the chance of donations, and Tyler agreed. It was decided that an event focusing on alums and some parents would be a good idea to move forward with, provided a venue could be secured quickly.

Edward also wanted to discuss the contracts for future RMs. The board identified several possibilities for contracts this year:

- Making no changes to the contract
- Switching to volunteer-run events in some or all regions
- Paying based on a percentage of sponsorships
- Paying as before, but gated based on sponsorships
- A hybrid model of these approaches

It was ultimately agreed that the best course would be to try a compensation model with payment gated on getting sponsorship, and with the option to cancel for failing to do so, in some regions, and to continue with the existing contracts in other regions.

## Adjournment of Meeting

The meeting was adjourned at 8:00pm by Edward Jiang.
