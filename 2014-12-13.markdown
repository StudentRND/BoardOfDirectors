Motion from Edward Jiang to approve the minutes from the meeting on October 29, 2014
**Vote:** 4 for, 0 against
**Resolved:** Motion carried

Tyler Menezes presented a report of StudentRND's operations over the last two months:
  - Most efforts were focused on closing CodeDay
  - StudentRND announced CodeX, which served to gain knowledge of how to close press, help close two sponsors, and to get the community excited about community engagement.
  - During CodeDay, #CodeDay was trending on Twitter! Overall, results were positive, as presented in the previous meeting
  - The Individual Donor Plan was put into place, with a goal of raising $10,000 by the end of the calendar year
  - StudentRND followed up with all students, sponsors, and venues involved in CodeDay in the form of a post-venue survey

Tyler Menezes presented a summary of the results from CodeDay versus the metrics. All metrics were met except global publicity and local sponsorship targets were not met.

Tyler Menezes presented the financial report for Q1 2014 (Q3 of the calendar year).

The board discussed the possibility of Labs. There was interest in continuing Labs from all members of the board, but it was agreed that no serious effort would be made
until more sponsorships were closed. The Board agreed to make a decision on Labs in the January 2015 meeting.

The meeting was temporarily adjourned until after the strategic planning session by Edward Jiang at 12pm.

The meeting was again called to order at 4:30pm.
