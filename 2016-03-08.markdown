### Long-Term Goals for StudentRND

Zaq presented the long-term goals he, Christy, and Tyler had discussed in an offline meeting:

- Several options: expanding in-city reach, expanding into more cities (including internationally), or running more programs.
- Expanding in-city reach would be the easiest, and is what the group was leaning toward in the previous meeting.
- In order to expand in-city reach, we would need to build more partnerships with schools and promotional orgs.
- We are currently discussing some new programs we could run in association with partners.

Bob mentioned that we should do customer development with previous attendees to see what sort of events they want next.
Bob also mentioned reaching out to Alaska or another airline for in-kind sponsorships.

The team discussed the huge opportunity in relatively small attendance (60 students) in many cities, and that it would
be a simple ask for donors, as more money would directly support more attendees. Christy mentioned that this could help
to close an opportunity gap for lower-income students.

Christy discussed further roles we should hire for, specifically a Development Director. The board discussed the
difficulty in finding someone.

### Adding Bob Crimmins to the Board

Motion from Tyler to add Bob Crimmins to the board.
**Vote:** 3 for, 0 against, 1 absent
**Resolved:** Motion carried

### Executive Director Salary Review

Tyler recused himself from the discussion. Christy presented salaries from several comparable organizations, in order
to review the compensation of the Executive Director. The board discussed options for the Executive Director
compensation.

Motion from Zaq to set Executive Director compensation to $40,000 per year.
**Vote:** 3 for, 0 against, 1 abstained, 1 absent
**Resolved:** Motion carried
