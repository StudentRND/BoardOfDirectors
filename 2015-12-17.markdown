**Resolved:** Motion carried

Tyler Presented the Executive Director Report:

- CodeDay Winter 2016 organizing is continuing:
  - We will be two months away from CodeDay as of Saturday.
  - At the moment, 8 cities have venues, which is mostly normal for this point.
  - The official deadline for getting venues is this weekend, and many do have venues, but it's likely some cities will take until next week to close a venue.
  - Some cities have sponsors already, and we are continuing to work with RMs with fewer sponsors in the past to try to close more sponsors.
- Sponsorships are going relatively well.
  - All paperwork is now signed for a 2016 sponsorship from LexisNexis for $25,000, will get a check before the end of the year.
  - Waiting to hear back from Splunk about their sponsorship in 2016 -- was supposed to get a response by the end of last week. Likely $50,000 again, with no increase. Still no paperwork there.
  - No response from Intellectual Ventures at all; their PR firm (who were our last known contact and we were told were in charge of grant giving at the moment) do not reply to emails.
  - Should hear back about two grants we applied for in January.
  - Got the help of a grantwriter (from Phoenix) who will be helping us apply for more grants.
  - Discussed fundraising with Bob Crimmins, who worked with Startup Weekend at an early stage; for Startup Weekend, according to Bob, having well-connected board members was critical. He volunteered to help us recruit those people for the board.

Tyler presented the Q1 financials.

The board reviewed Tyler's proposed chairman job description:
- Christy mentioned it would be useful to specify both a specific time and financial commitment in the description.
- Edward suggested changing instances of "oversee" to "ensure" to reflect the position's focus on creating accountability.
- Christy recommended adding a specific expected and maximum term to the position.
- Edward suggested making recurring meetings with board members a part of the description as well.

The board discussed Edward's plan to resign from the board.

Motion from Tyler to elect Zaq as the new Chairman of the Board, to replace Edward.
**Vote:** 5 for, 0 against
**Resolved:** Motion carried

Edward resigned his position on the board.

The board discussed what to do about recruiting Bob Crimmins from the board; it was agreed that Zaq and Tyler would meet
with him, and would report back at the next board meeting, with the expectation that if he seems like a good fit, we may
ask him to be an observer at the meeting following that.

## Adjournment of Meeting

The meeting was adjourned at 8:00pm by Tyler Menezes.
