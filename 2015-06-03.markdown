### Executive Director Report

Tyler Menezes presented a report of StudentRND's operations since the last meeting:

#### CodeDay

- Overall success, attendees really seemed to enjoy it.
- Lots of pre-event press.
	- e.g. 5 minute special on Univision nation-wide.
		- 1 story in about 40% of markets
	- 40% girls, 20% minorities. No delta in girls but that's a 5 point increase in minorities. Things like Univision helped, but largely through promotion with partner schools.
	- NPS: 68 -- up 10 points. Overall much more positive feedback about Evangelists, so improved training works.
		- Most neutral feedback mentioned bad wifi in the comments.
	- As mentioned, lower sponsorship over last quarter. We contacted the expected number of sponsors, but almost none closed. Did raise $3k in global sponsors, $5k in local.
	- Expenses down from last quarter. We made about $10k off this season, even with lower than expected sponsorship. Mostly due to no shirts, but also by cutting food spend; further reducing air spend.

#### Labs

We only have 10 people who've paid for the program now, 6 in session I, 4 in session II. There was a WAY higher than expected dropoff. We'd technically make a profit, but I don't think it's in the interest of most of the students Tyler talked to, who were more interested in group work.

Metrics were similar to last year, except with a very high dropoff between accepted and paid, which caused most of the lack of participation.

We promoted Labs in:

- parent newsletters from school districts -- Seattle, Bellevue, and Lake Washington school districts
- references and a referral program from past parents
- references and referrals from past students
- some robotics teams
- meetups
- online advertising (Google non-profits adwords credit)

We tried also promoting in the SF bay region in case students were interested in traveling, because of the larger market. ~10% of applications were from students outside of Seattle.

We hit the metrics we were expecting, which I think shows in the increase of signups.

Some potential reasons we might have failed to convert as many:

- Some parents told me they weren't sold on the qualifications of our team after the interviews
- The long lead-time between applications (January) and interviews (May) may have caused 

**The board agreed to cancel Labs 2015,** without any motion. The board also suggested arranging some form of mentorship for the students involved.

### Financials

- Total assets: 18,672
