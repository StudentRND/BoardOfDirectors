## Business

Motion from Edward Jiang to approve the minutes from the meeting on January 28, 2015
**Vote:** 4 for, 0 against
**Resolved:** Motion carried

Tyler Menezes presented a report of StudentRND's operations since the last meeting:

- CodeDay went well overall, with no last-minute problem this time. NPS increased to 56, diversity increased to 15% minorities, maintained 40% girls. Lost a small amount of money on CodeDay, still processing reimbursements.
- Currently have 29 CodeDay cities on the map, with RMs signed on for 85% of them. Will likely remove 3, so no growth from last season.
- Currently in talks with 30 companies for sponsorship of next season. Creating sponsor personas and using them to redo the sponsor site and update promotional materials.
- Working on improving Evangelism and RM training in addition to finishing up administrative work on CodeDays.
- Hired a Labs program manager, and got 5 applicants for Labs. Currently working on closing the venue. Brett is also talking to some companies that were interested in sponsoring Labs.

Tyler Menezes covered the progress on the Strategic Plan:

- Made some changes as suggested: created KPIs, normalized goals to ARR for the fiscal year, and updated some details on the competitor section
- Not ready for a vote, as Tyler was unable to work with Christy and Charlie on the press and branding strategy because of schedule constraints.

Christy and Charlie agreed to meet later in the week, and Tyler said he would revise the documents after those meetings and send them out to the board for review.

Tyler Menezes presented the Q2 Financials.

Tyler Menezes discussed a request for a fiscal sponsorship from Zach Latta, who has been a long-time CodeDay organizer. The board voted against fiscal sponsorship because it was an ongoing, non-event based organization, which is distracting from what StudentRND does.


## Adjournment of Meeting
