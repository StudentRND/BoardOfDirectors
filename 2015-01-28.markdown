## Business

Motion from Edward Jiang to approve the minutes from the meeting on December 13, 2014
**Vote:** 4 for, 0 against
**Resolved:** Motion carried

Tyler Menezes presented a report of StudentRND's operations since the last meeting:

- There was a major problem with CodeDay: the two-season RM contracts meant a lot of RMs which weren't really committed dropped out half-way through the season
- We will have to make some more adjustments to hiring for RMs because of high turnover, will stay the same for now
- The Splunk sponsorship closed at $50k
- The other $25k sponsor we were talking to backed out after we sent a contract
- We have several $5k local and national sponsors
- We also have a decent number of local sponsors
- CodeDays are selling out faster this time. We had to open a second CodeDay Seattle.
- Launched #CodeDate, a promotion to get more couples to come to CodeDay because it's on Valentine's day
- CodeDay LA: announced it's being hosted by wil.i.am
- Opened partnerships with TEALS and HackEDU (school clubs)
- Labs site was updated, ready to hire a program manager if board approves

Motion from Charlie Kindel to approve Labs for 2015 and hire a program manager
**Vote:** 4 for, 0 against
**Resolved:** Motion carried

- Move Competetors to an appendix
- Include more details on CodeX as an appendix
- Prioritize weaknesses: press, volunteers
- Include more on press strategy, pending input from Charlie and Christy

The board asked Tyler to make the revisions for presentation at the next meeting.
