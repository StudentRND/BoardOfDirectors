- Registrations are proceeding 10% faster than last season
- We have 54 applications for Labs so far, about as many as we had last year

Edward discussed the people on the list of candidates for the board. He asked for any additions to the list generated since the last meeting, but none were added. The board agreed to focus efforts on fundraising-related roles and an alumni role. Edward agreed to work on getting someone for the fundraising role, and Tyler agreed to work on the Alumni role with feedback from Edward.

The board discussed the on-boarding process for candidates, and decided to invite new candidates to the May 2015 meeting as an observer, as well as track the help they're able to provide outside of a position on the board, and aim to have new members added by June.
