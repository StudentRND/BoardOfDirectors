# Record of Discussion

## Changing Fiscal Year

Tyler said that he would like to adopt the fiscal year ending June 30 starting with June 30, 2014. He mentioned that this would create a short period from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014.
  
Tyler mentioned that he sent out a summary of the reasons for this change, and asked if all board members had read the summary. All board members confirmed that they had. He asked if they felt familiar with the upsides and downsides, or if there were any questions. There were no questions.

Tyler motioned to adopt the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. Mike seconded the motion. The motion was approved unanimously.

## Edward Leaving

Tyler mentioned that Edward was leaving, and asked Edward to lead a discussion of the issue.

Edward summarized his reason for leaving: he had been involved in StudentRND for a five years with the goal of expanding to all over the US. With the most recent set of events, this goal was achieved, so after discussing with Christy and Tyler, he felt that this would be a good time to move on.

Tyler summarized the transition plan:

- Edward will still be acting as a Regional Manager for CodeDay.
- Edward will be helping with Regional Manager recruiting, which is to be complete by August.
- Edward will be helping with recruiting someone to assume some of his responsibilities full-time by August.
- Edward will be helping with Labs.

Edward asked if there were any other questions directly related to him leaving. Mike mentioned that he was concerned about whether this affected the morale of the organization. Tyler said that it did not.

Christy asked that Edward continue as in a volunteer advisory role. Edward confirmed that he would, and would also remain on the board.

## Appointment of new Executive Director

Edward led a discussion of how to best transition his roles. He began by asking the board to consider whether Tyler would be the appropriate person for the role, or whether someone new should be hired.

Charlie asked how the board could be sure that Tyler would be effective in his new role, as well as satisfied with the work. Tyler replied that he had, in his past job, worked on sales, and was currently in charge of general management in his current role as Program Director. He said that other than general strategic thinking, which would also involve the Board and Edward, he could think of no other present aspects of the job, and asked if Edward could thought of any. Edward confirmed that he could not think of any other aspects of the job.

Edward asked how Tyler could be sure this was a role he wanted to assume. Tyler said that he could not be sure since he had not done it, but was confident based on past experience.

Christy suggested that Tyler be given an interim position as Executive Director. Tyler indicated that he was not opposed to this, but that if they needed to conduct an exhaustive search for a replacement the decision would need to be made almost immediately to hire for this role. 

Mike asked what Edward’s plan was for transitioning out of his role. Edward indicated that he intended to cease most day-to-day activities on June 30, and resign on August 18. Mike suggested that the resignation be made sooner so that the company had a full-time executive responsible to the board for day-to-day responsibilities.

Edward asked when the resignation should be announced. Charlie recommended separating the issues.

Christy suggested that Edward resign on June 30, and that he announce that he would be taking an advisory role as soon as possible.

Edward asked to turn the discussion to whether Tyler should take over as Executive Director and, if so, whether on an interim basis. Tyler indicated that he felt confident assuming the role without the interim expectation. Mike moved that Tyler be elected Executive Director effective June 30. The board voted unanimously for the motion.

Tyler suggested that the resignation be announced as soon as possible. There was no objection, however no formal motion was made.

Christy suggested Edward reach out to sponsors in advance of the transition to let them know.

## Hiring of Partnerships Director

Tyler asked that the board provide advice on the hiring of a Partnerships director.

The board members provided some specific advice on wording of the job posting, which Tyler indicated he would incorporate into the posting. Mike offered to forward the description to friends who’d hired for similar positions in the past.

Tyler asked for feedback on the hiring process. Mike suggested that he ask for help in vetting candidates from people at similar organizations. Christy suggested asking friends for intros as much as possible.

Tyler asked if the salary would likely be a concern for candidates. Mike said that it might be, but was not outside the realm of possibility. Christy and Charlie agreed.

Tyler asked for a commitment from the directors to interview potential candidates. All agreed.
