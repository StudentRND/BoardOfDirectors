Tyler Presented the Executive Director Report:

- CodeDay Winter 2016 is this weekend:
  - Attendance numbers are up 5% from this time last season.
  - Financials: At the local event level, we have raised $3,000 in sponsorship so far. Expecting final sponsorships to be $4300 with a few deals expected to close this week. Including food sponsors, we're expecting to realize a profit of about $6,000 with the current budgets. Still missing several budgets.
  - We've also booked close to $90,000 since the last board meeting, between Splunk, LexisNexis, and an individual donation campaign for CodeDay sponsorships. We've also applied for $150,000 in grant funding across five grants. We're expecting to hear back from one each month for the next five months. Continuing to work with Kristin from CodeDay Phoenix, who's a grantwriter. Most of this funding is amortized.
  - Press and Branding: We've completed an update to the CodeDay branding, as well as a redesign of the CodeDay website, which we've been working on for several months. User testing showed 40% more engagement with the new site over the old site. This also comes with updated sponsorship and press materials, and an updated video. We've had positive reception from media; two TV news stations are planning to come to the upcoming CodeDay in San Francisco, one in Arizona, and one in Nashville.
  - We've updated our training for Evangelists, and are finishing updated training for RMs. We have also been developing training for mentors and other volunteers; with a new volunteer tool we're deploying after this CodeDay, we're expecting to do a big push for more involvement from local members of the tech community and from parents. This fits into our strategy of increasing engagement with parents.
- Zaq and Tyler met with Bob, who gave some good guidance on recruiting board members who can create connections; Zaq has this on the agenda already, so no more details are provided here.

Charlie complimented the new branding direction, and asked for the status on sponsors he'd introduced; Tyler responded that he was unable to close them for this event, but expected to be able to for the following event.


- The board asked for some changes to be made to the board flyer.
  - Update the language on the headings
  - Explain the "why" earlier
  - Add the StudentRND URL earlier
  - Explain expected qualifications earlier.

The board discussed next-steps for onboarding Bob Crimmins as a board member:
  - Meet with him, and pitch him with the updated pitch
  - Have him join the next board meeting as an observer

The board asked for improvements for speeding up further board meetings:
  - Potentially adding canned tasks that board members could pick up
  - Setting clear follow-up tasks
  - A standard format for updates
  - Sending updates at least 1 week in advance

Follow-up tasks for next meeting:

  - Charlie meeting about press brand
  - Christy + Zaq talk about 2 year plan + specific recruiting targets
  - Zaq work with Tyler on board format

## Adjournment of Meeting

The meeting was adjourned at 8:00pm by Zaq Wiedmann.
